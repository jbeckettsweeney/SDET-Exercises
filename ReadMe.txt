This file will serve as instructions for how to run the files I have prepared for the Schedulicity SDET Exercises.

To see my thoughts and experience going through the exercises, please read through Thoughts.txt.


--Instructions

These instructions assume that Protractor and all necessary related files are already installed. For instructions on getting all of that, please visit https://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial

Step 1.
Save the files 'conf.js' and 'spec.js' to a place on your machine.

Step 2.
Open a terminal, then use 'webdriver-manager start' to start up a server.

Step 3.
Open a second terminal, then navigate to the directory where the above .js files are saved.

Step 4.
Type the command 'protractor conf.js', then watch it go to work! It should say how many tests it ran, how many failed, and how long it took to run them all.

Thanks for reading!
